# Post-Peachtree update

Thanks so much to all of you who participated in our Peachtree research forum in July 2019. We know you set aside a lot of time to work with us even though all of you are busy and we really appreciate it. Hopefully, you found it valuable too.

Here are the photos of the various walls of sticky notes we created together:
