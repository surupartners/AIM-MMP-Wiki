Hello AIM! In this update we'll let you know where we are at in the project and expand a little on the approach we're taking.

## Our project approach
We are process-driven, not technology-driven. This means that primarily the project team is here to listen to you, learn from you and map AIM's process for personnel; we'll then use this learning to develop systems to facilitate that process. We are not going to select technology and then force AIM's process into the limits of said technology.

There are three main phases:

1. [Research](./overview.md#research)
1. [Design](./overview.md#design)
1. [Build/implementation](./overview.md#build-implementation)

You can learn more about what's involved in these phases of the MMP project [**here →**](./overview.md#how-are-we-doing-it)

## Progress to date
<img class="l-push-bottom" src="/images/july-2019-update-timeline.jpg" />

We're about half way through our [research phase](./overview.md#research). We started with a number of discovery calls with some key people in AIM including REOs, RAOs and the IO to discover who in AIM we needed to talk to as well as helping them understand our collaborative project approach. 

Then, over the last 5–6 weeks, we've been conducting in-depth research calls — six with receiving regions and four with mobilising regions, each lasting 2–3 hours with more to come — in which we've been mapping out their processes, asking questions and digesting written homework. It's been fantastic to dig into each office's specific context and understand what commonalities exist and, crucially, how each office's needs differ.

Coming up at the end of July is a dedicated research forum in Peachtree with a number of regions joining us there. We'll be doing some live process mapping as well as digging into the systems each office uses for their personnel process.

After this we'll be looping back to offices we've already spoken to in follow-up calls to fill in gaps in our knowledge as well as further in-depth research calls with teams we've not spoken to yet.

A big thank you to everyone who's helped us with the project so far, especially all of you who have given us your valuable time for our research sessions.

As always, if you have comments, questions or suggestions please get in touch with us on [**hrissupport@aimint.org**](mailto:hrissupport@aimint.org)

# June 2019

Thus far, our primary focus has been on research and listening. The project team has been engaging with representatives from various AIM offices to make initial introductions and identify relevant individuals to involve in the research process. We have enjoyed speaking with many of you will be continuing to do so in more depth in the coming weeks.

This research will be carried out via face-to-face sessions and Skype calls, helping us to document the current processes that the new systems will need to support. Once the research is complete in the coming months we will start considering specific software platforms and designing how they should work.

Please do continue to send in your questions, comments and suggestions to [**hrissupport@aimint.org**](mailto:hrissupport@aimint.org) and will ensure they're considered within the process. We really value the feedback we've already received.

# April 2019

We're announcing the AIM MMP (Member Management Project). First, read the [project overview](/overview) to understand what the project is aiming to achieve.

We’re in the early stages of the project so will be spending our time over the coming weeks researching and listening to your needs. 

## What to expect in the coming months
We’re going to be working with many of the AIM offices in mid- to late-2019 to carefully assess the impact this will have on their existing processes, systems and personnel. We’ll also be asking to interview a number of you to hear about your roles, the systems you use day to day and how we can best support you.

We’ll be aiming to co-design these new systems with you to work in harmony with or replace your offices' existing technology to make your jobs easier (rather than adding another thing for you to worry about). We’ll also be coordinating with you to ensure as smooth a transition to any new systems as possible.

We know many of you are keen to start using some of the capabilities the new system will have. We will be structuring the project so as to roll-out functionality quickly to teams who need it without forcing change on teams before they are ready. 

If you’d like to know specifically when certain features will be available, contact us on [**hrissupport@aimint.org**](mailto:hrissupport@aimint.org) and we’ll keep you updated on specifics. We will also be releasing regular updates about the project timelines and progress.

## What you should do now 
We’d soon like to start talking to those who will be affected by or want to feed into the project. If you or member of your team would like to be included in those interviews, please let us know at [**hrissupport@aimint.org**](mailto:hrissupport@aimint.org) and we’ll be sure to seek your input.

You may wish to share this overview with your colleagues, if you feel that's appropriate. The information might assuage any fears or concerns they may have about the project.
