## What are we doing
The AIM MMP (Member Management Platform) project aims to replace the CHARIS system with something that provides better functionality and works for all the AIM offices. 

The three main areas we're focusing on are:

1. recruitment & on-boarding;
1. requisitions & assignments; and
1. personnel data & tracking.

Requisitions and personnel data are currently provided by CHARIS and we’re looking to provide them in the new system; recruitment and on-boarding is currently done by each office independently and we’re aiming to provide a single system that works for all offices’ workflows.

The project will start with research; time spent listening to you and your needs. We’re working with an external consultancy, [Suru Partners](https://surupartners.com), who will be providing guidance and best practice throughout as well as bringing an impartial perspective that’s not tied to any particular AIM office or product vendor.

Our research will inform the scope of what the new system will be able to support across the three areas. We are confident that, through this process, we will identify where a new system will reduce duplication, speed up processes and generally reduce administrative burden across the organisation. We also need to be realistic — AIM's resources are not unlimited so not every idea we discuss in our research (nor everything you currently do across all your on- and off-line processes) will be incorporated into the new system. However, we are confident that by working together we can prioritise the right things and achieve another leap forward in technological support for our great commission.

You can see how we're progressing through the project with our [project updates](./updates.md).

## Why are we doing it
The current CHARIS system was a great advance for AIM to bring our process of handling personnel data from pen, paper, email and separated systems to a global personnel system. This success represented a lot of effort from the AIM team.

However it created various pain points that we aim to address:

- reduce the high ongoing financial cost; 
- provide a more stable & flexible platform for AIM's processes;
- improve usability for a larger rollout to be used by members & applicants; and
- fulfill the goal of replacing systems used for the crucial tasks of recruitment and on-boarding in Mobilizing Regions.

Furthermore, whilst CHARIS brought AIM's personnel processes firmly into the digital age we estimate that it supports only 30% of what could be supported. We aim to significantly increase the coverage that the new system provides.

## Who’s involved 
Walt Middleton is the IO project owner and will continue be involved but Ted Barnett Jr. is the primary contact person for the team. He will be able to answer any questions you have and will ensure any suggestions, concerns or information you share are incorporated into the project’s design. 

Ted and Walt are working with [Suru Partners](https://surupartners.com), experienced technology consultants from the UK who are conducting the core research and design work for the project.

You can contact the team for any conversations, requests or support regarding this project on the following email address: [**hrissupport@aimint.org**](mailto:hrissupport@aimint.org)

## How are we doing it

We are process-driven, not technology-driven. This means that primarily the project team is here to listen to you, learn from you and map AIM's process for personnel; we'll then use this learning to develop systems to facilitate that process. We are not going to select technology and then force AIM's process into the limits of said technology.

There are three main phases:

1. Research
1. Design
1. Build/implementation

In reality, our phases of work are not so linear. Inevitably we'll find areas we didn't research enough so we will go back and do more homework where necessary. Even the latter stages of design and build will not be entirely linear; as we co-design and test the system(s) with all of you we'll revise and iterate our approach in response to ongoing feedback and learning.

We're also running these phases in parallel for each of the core system areas (Recruitment & Onboarding, Requisitions & Assignments and Personnel Data & Tracking) so there will be overlap as we discover how these areas depend on each and should best interact.

### Research
In this phase we cast a wide net to discover the realities of your day to day work, the roles you perform and the processes that drive AIM. This is drive 80% by you; we're here to listen, understand and ask questions.

### Design
Guided by what we learn from the research phase, the design phase is a collaborative phase where we're digesting what we've learned, you're helping us identify priorities and together we're mapping out what the technology needs to do for us. This phase is driven 50:50 between you and us.

### Build & implementation
Here we'll be working with you to implement the system design, continually validating what we're creating with you as we go. This is driven 80% by us but we'll be working closely with you to develop rollout, integration and data migration plans that work for you (though you'll have been helping us design how the systems make these processes as easy as possible during the design phase).

## Where to get more information
It’s natural to wonder what impact all this will have on your role and your team. Please feel free to reach out to Ted and the team at any time to ask for clarification, or simply to share any worries you may have about how this will affect you. You can also ask Ted to be kept in the loop about certain aspects of the project such as the timeline for a particular piece of functionality.

Please direct any immediate questions or comments you have to me and the team at [**hrissupport@aimint.org**](mailto:hrissupport@aimint.org)
