## What are we doing
The AIM MMP (Member Management Platform) project aims to replace the CHARIS system with something that provides better functionality and works for all the AIM offices. 

The three main areas we're focusing on are:

1. recruitment & on-boarding;
1. requisitions & assignments; and
1. personnel data & tracking.

Requisitions and personnel data are currently provided by CHARIS and we’re looking to provide them in the new system; recruitment and on-boarding is currently done by each office independently and we’re aiming to provide a single system that works for all offices’ workflows.

The project will start with research; time spent listening to you and your needs. We’re working with an external consultancy, [Suru Partners](https://surupartners.com), who will be providing guidance and best practice throughout as well as bringing an impartial perspective that’s not tied to any particular AIM office or product vendor.

Our research will inform the scope of what the new system will be able to support across the three areas. We are confident that, through this process, we will identify where a new system will reduce duplication, speed up processes and generally reduce administrative burden across the organisation. We also need to be realistic — AIM's resources are not unlimited so not every idea we discuss in our research (nor everything you currently do across all your on- and off-line processes) will be incorporated into the new system. However, we are confident that by working together we can prioritise the right things and achieve another leap forward in technological support for our great commission.

## Why are we doing it
The current CHARIS system was a great advance for AIM to bring our process of handling personnel data from pen, paper, email and separated systems to a global personnel system. This success represented a lot of effort from the AIM team.

However it created various pain points that we aim to address:

- reduce the high ongoing financial cost; 
- provide a more stable & flexible platform for AIM's processes;
- improve usability for a larger rollout to be used by members & applicants; and
- fulfill the goal of replacing systems used for the crucial tasks of recruitment and on-boarding in Mobilizing Regions.

Furthermore, whilst CHARIS brought AIM's personnel processes firmly into the digital age we estimate that it supports only 30% of what could be supported. We aim to significantly increase the coverage that the new system provides.
