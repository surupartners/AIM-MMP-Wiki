# Research

Dear Walt, Karen et al.

We've now completed the research phase of the MMP project. This page indexes the various documents and diagrams which represent what we've seen and heard.

The first thing we'll do in the design phase is to extract from our research the areas of functionality that the new MMP system(s) _could_ cover, format and package them in an easy to understand and summarised way, and then present them to you (and, later, the rest of AIM) to start the conversation about what the MMP should include in its scope. Once the scope of the MMP is decided we'll begin technology platform selection and more detailed design work.

At this point, please review the research to check for any misunderstandings, errors or omissions.

    This document some high level issues that will need resolving as part of this project (eg, such and such an IO policy is ambiguous and will need adjusting before we implement the MMP) or obvious areas of focus for the design phase to explore as part of the aforementioned work to define the project scope.

    This document is a mixture of team-identified requirements (ie, things that Suru, Ted or Lisa have spotted during the research which the MMP might need to cover) and specific requests from AIM people (either emailed into the MMP project team or raised during research sessions). A number of items from this document will, during the the design phase, be extracted into the summary mentioned above of possible areas of functionality of the MMP.
